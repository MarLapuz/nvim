# Neovim Config

This is a repository for storing and sharing my Neovim configurations. It includes custom settings, plugins, and color schemes to enhance productivity and text editing experience. It serves as a backup for the configuration and makes it easy to sync settings across multiple devices. It's made public in case others find it useful.
