# Neovim Config

This is my personal repository for storing and sharing my Neovim configurations. It includes all my custom settings, plugins, and color schemes that I use to enhance my productivity and text editing experience.

I created this repository as a way to backup my configurations and to make it easier for me to sync my settings across multiple devices. I have also decided to make it public in case others may find it useful.

In this repository, you'll find my configuration that I've gathered over time and I've tested them for myself and I'm using them on my daily basis.
